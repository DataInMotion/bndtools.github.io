Bndtools is an Eclipse Plugin based on [bnd][1] with the goal to make programming for OSGi easier than in 
any other environment. Correction, to make programming in Java easier than any other environment!

As a plugin Bndtools hooks into the IDE in numerous places. Clearly, Eclipse already provides a very comprehensive
Java programming environment and Bndtools leverages this to the hilt. 

The following image provides an overview of the most important views in the Bndtools plugin. You can click on the
view and it should take you to the appropriate place.

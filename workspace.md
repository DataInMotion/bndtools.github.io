# Workspace

Bndtools is based on the _bnd workspace_ model as described in the [concepts](concepts.html). In its most simple form
this means that there is a single directory that contains all the projects. This directory generally matches
the `.git` workspace, the gradle workspace, and the Eclipse workspace.

Using the bnd workspace means that you can work almost full time in Eclipse while a continuous integration build
with, for example, Github Actions using Gradle is automatically supported.

This page contains a number of videos that explain how to get started with the workspace model. It is assumed 
that you have a Java VM installed and that Eclipse is running with the [latest Bndtools](installation.md).

If you try this out, it is recommended to have the Java 1.8 VM installed as default.

## Install

The following video shows how to install a workspace from a template and start a _palyground_ project with the 
Apache Felix Gogo shell.
